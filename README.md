## ðŸ“ˆ Linear Regression (Continuation)

**Problem Statement**:  
Apply multivariate linear regression on extended datasets.

**Data**:  
- Source: Simple regression (`advertising`).

**Data Mining Operations**:  
- Handled additional features and multicollinearity checks.
- Re-trained models with multiple predictors.
- Refined model with feature selection and engineering.

**Model Outputs**:  
- Improved regression graphs and prediction accuracy.
- Updated correlation matrices.

**Limitations**:  
- Adding irrelevant variables could increase noise in model results.

**Were you able to effectively solve the problem?**  
Yes, multivariate regressions demonstrated improved predictive performance.
